Today, June 30th, 2008, is a very special day. It is the last day of the first half-year, and also the last day of my IT career. Because all my demission procedures, at last, have been finished.

Five years ago I was forced to give up studying as graduate student, then took the programming job just for bread and butter. Time flies fast and the heavy work left me much experience and knowledge. It is time for me to go back to my amazing life science research now. My another new life, preparing the exam, begins formally from now on.
